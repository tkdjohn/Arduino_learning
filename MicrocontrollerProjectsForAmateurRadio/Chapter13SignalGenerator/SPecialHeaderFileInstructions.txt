For Signal Generator:

The SG display uses the ILI9488 device driver and the code meeds to know
about that. Therefore, uncomment line 47:

  define ILI9488_DRIVER     // WARNING: Do not connect ILI9488 display SDO to MISO if other devices share the SPI bus 
                            // (TFT SDO does NOT tristate when CS is high)

in the User_Setup.h header file.

The following lines are also uncommented:

279  #define LOAD_GLCD   // Font 1. Original Adafruit 8 pixel font needs ~1820 bytes in FLASH
280  #define LOAD_FONT2  // Font 2. Small 16 pixel high font, needs ~3534 bytes in FLASH, 96 characters
281  #define LOAD_FONT4  // Font 4. Medium 26 pixel high font, needs ~5848 bytes in FLASH, 96 characters
282  #define LOAD_FONT6  // Font 6. Large 48 pixel font, needs ~2666 bytes in FLASH, only characters 1234567890:-.apm
283  #define LOAD_FONT7  // Font 7. 7 segment 48 pixel font, needs ~2438 bytes in FLASH, only characters 1234567890:-.
284  #define LOAD_FONT8  // Font 8. Large 75 pixel font needs ~3256 bytes in FLASH, only characters 1234567890:-.
285  //  Leave this commented out...
286  #define LOAD_GFXFF  // FreeFonts. Include access to the 48 Adafruit_GFX free fonts FF1 to FF48 and custom fonts
287
288  // Comment out the #define below to stop the SPIFFS filing system and smooth font code being loaded
289  // this will save ~20kbytes of FLASH
290 #define SMOOTH_FONT
...
309 #define SPI_FREQUENCY  27000000
...
318 #define SPI_TOUCH_FREQUENCY  2500000

in the User_Setup.h header file.   

Because the SG uses a touch screen, the library needs to know that so the 
appropriate code is pulled in. You need to uncomment line 163:

   #define TOUCH_CS PIN_D2     // Chip select pin (T_CS) of touch screen

in the User_Setup.h header file.   

After you've made these changes, save the file.
